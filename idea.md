# Idea: Rubik’s Cube Solver & Trainer App

## Summary
A mobile app that not only solves a Rubik’s Cube using your camera but also teaches you how to solve it yourself.  
It guides users with step-by-step solution moves, provides tutorials for different solving methods, and includes practice tools (like quizzes and timers) to help users improve their cubing skills.

## Problem
Many beginners can solve one side of a Rubik’s Cube but struggle to finish the entire cube.  
Existing solver apps will tell you the moves to solve a scrambled cube, but they don’t teach you why those moves work or how to get better.  

This creates a gap between “getting a solution” and “understanding how to solve.”  
That’s the gap this app idea fills.

## Solution
Combine an instant solver with a learning tool.  

- The app gives a quick solution for any scrambled cube.  
- It breaks the solution into small, understandable steps with visuals.  
- Over time, the user can transition from relying on the solver to using the app as a tutor and then solving independently.

## Key Features

### Camera Cube Scanner
- Scan all 6 faces of the cube with your phone’s camera.  
- Detect sticker colors and build a digital cube model.  
- Manual color picker option for users without camera access.

### Step-by-Step Solve Guide
- Solution computed with Kociemba’s two-phase algorithm.  
- Interactive guide with:
  - Notation (e.g., `R U R' U'`).  
  - Visual animations of cube turns.  
- Users follow along move by move on their real cube.

### Learning Sections
- Beginner Method – Layer-by-Layer (3×3) with full guidance.  
- CFOP Method – Advanced (Cross, F2L, OLL, PLL).  
- Other Methods – Roux, ZZ, Petrus (brief intros for curious learners).

### Algorithm Library
- Browse common algorithms by name or cube pattern.  
- Each entry shows:
  - Notation  
  - Cube animation  
  - Explanation of what it accomplishes.

### Flashcards (Quiz Mode)
- Show a cube case (e.g., OLL/PLL) and prompt the user to recall the algorithm.  
- Tap to reveal notation and animation.  
- Uses spaced repetition so difficult algorithms appear more often, easier ones less frequently.  
- Inspired by how cubers already use flashcard apps like Anki to memorize algorithms.

### Timer & Stats
- Speedcubing timer with inspection mode.  
- Save history, track best and average times.  
- Built-in scramble generator for practice.

### Tutorials & Tips
- Curated YouTube tutorials and cubing tips.  
- Organized by Beginner, Intermediate, and Advanced levels.

### Community & Challenges (Future idea)
- Daily or weekly scramble challenges.  
- Achievements and badges (e.g., First Solve, Sub-1 Minute).  
- Leaderboard for fastest solves.  
- Share tips, times, and tricks with others.

### Support for Other Puzzles
- Expand beyond 3×3:  
  - 2×2 (beginner-friendly).  
  - 4×4 (with reduction and parity fixes).  
  - Pyraminx, Megaminx, and others.

## Why It’s a Great Idea

### Learning by Doing
Instead of just giving solutions, the app encourages users to follow along and solve. This active participation helps users remember the moves and understand the solve process.

### Bridges the Gap
Acts like training wheels: users rely on the app at first, then grow into independent solvers.

### Backed by Study Techniques
- Spaced repetition improves long-term memory.  
- Flashcards are already used by cubers to learn algorithms.  
- Dual coding (visuals plus text) enhances recall.

### All-in-One Convenience
Replaces multiple tools: solver app, YouTube tutorials, flashcard apps, and timers — all in one.

### Motivation via Progress
Achievements, leaderboards, and progress stats keep users coming back.

### Appeals to All Levels
- Beginners learn the basics.  
- Advanced cubers practice drills, algorithm training, and solve timers.

## References & Inspiration
- Speedcubers recommend spaced repetition flashcards (like Anki) for algorithm learning.  
- SpeedCubeShop sells flashcards and guides for cubers, showing the demand for systematic learning tools.  
- Popular YouTubers (JPerm, Feliks Zemdegs) inspire the tutorial design.  
- Existing solver apps inspired scanning/instant solve, but this project goes further by teaching.

## Conclusion
The Rubik’s Cube Solver & Trainer App blends a handy solver tool with an educational platform.  

- Today, users may rely on it to solve their cube.  
- After practice, they can solve independently.  
- With continuous use, they improve speed, learn new methods, and engage with the cubing community.
